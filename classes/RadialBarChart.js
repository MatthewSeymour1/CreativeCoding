//Using the arc() function.
//Note the data needs to be sorted, the least is on the inside of the circle, the most on the outermost
//As you can see from the example image, the largest piece of data will always occupy 75% of the circle.
//Not sure yet if the numbers should be counted as in image1, or if there should be a kind of measurement around the circle as in image2.
//Note in image2 there are faded lines coming towards the center from each number measurement. That seems good to do.
